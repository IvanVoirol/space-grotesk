<p>Space Grotesk is a sans-serif typeface and a proportional variant of the original fixed-width Space Mono family. Designed by Florian Karsten in 2018, Space Grotesk retains Colophon's Foundry Space Mono quirkiness and personality but was optimised for better readability at non-display sizes.</p>

<p>Since its initial release in 2018, Space Grotesk was later heavily reworked and completed with previously missing or suppressed Space Mono design features for 2020 Google Fonts release.</p>

<p>Space Grotesk supports Google Fonts Latin Plus character set, as well as several OpenType features (old-style and tabular figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, stylistic alternates).</p>
